A small express server connected with a postgres database for the storage and authentication of users.

Using github actions, this repo will run a small pipeline when pushing to main or any branch.

If all unit tests pass, the latest commit will be deployed from Render - the live service can be found [here](https://user-auth-k2wn.onrender.com/api)

## ðŸ’« Live api

This api has been hosted on Render [here](https://user-auth-k2wn.onrender.com/api). As this is a free tier for the purpose of this repo, the service will spin down from inactivity and can take up to 50 seconds to respon.
